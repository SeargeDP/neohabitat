		"     THINGS TO DO IN HABITAT            Congratulations!  You're one of the     Habitat pioneers.  When you get done    wandering around your Turf, picking     things up and putting them away again,  changing the color of your furniture,   fiddling with the lights, and generally learning how things work, you're        probably going to ask yourself, \"So,    what do I do here?\"                                                             A good way to start getting yourself    oriented is to learn how to use the     TelePort network.  In order to TelePort you'll need cash, so you'll have to find                   3                    ",

Today, the thieves in the now famous    \"Great Amulet Caper\" were found guilty  of Grand Theft Magic, and sentenced to 5years in The Void.  In pronouncing the  sentence to a hushed, packed courtroom, Judge Themonioli was solemn.  \"Zap'em   'til they glow!\" he said, \"let the      Oracle sort'em out!  Next case!\"                                                The story began last week when the GreatAmulet of Wonderous Worth was stolen    from the Back-Forty home of Habitat's   resident Not-So-Wise-Man, Dada Salesh.                     5                    ",
		"Salesh, a powerful but clumsy wizard,   tried to retrieve the valuable trinket  with a homing-return spell, but his     attempt backfired.  Instead of          recovering the stolen property, Salesh  accidentally Ported the thieves         themselves to his house.  Although this resulted in the thieves' immediate      capture, the Amulet is still missing.                                           All attempts by officials to extract    information from the evil-doers have    been in vain.  It is feared that the    Amulet may remain forever lost.                                                                    6                    ",

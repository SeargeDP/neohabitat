Fall '87 AC                                        Populoplis, New Marin-                                                              All trading of Habitat stocks has   been suspended because of the infux of  humans into our world. The oracle has   pronounced that a NEW method of stock   & securities exchange will be           instigated \"Whenever I am ready\".                                                   Perhaps, with the humans among us,  the market will be stimulated. I know I am already!  \u001c\u001c                                     \u0014\u001b\u001b\u0013                                         Publisher, HSEN        "

The courthouse on Entrprys Street was introduced to Habitat fairly late on during the Pilot test. [Archived copies of The Rant in-world newspaper](https://frandallfarmer.github.io/neohabitat-doc/docs/historical/HabitatDocuments.html) first mention it appearing in February 1988. Here is an excerpt from the [March 2nd, 1988 edition](https://frandallfarmer.github.io/neohabitat-doc/docs/historical/Text/text-03021988-rant-vol2-no8.json.html) regarding the opening of this area.

> Come be part of the jury when Habitat's
 new courthouse on Entrprys opens this  
 Saturday, March 5, at 10 pm HST in The 
 Great Amulet Caper Case re-trial. The  
 criminal will be re-tried by Judge CLB,
 who has been appointed by The Oracle to
 replace Judge Themonioli, who failed an
 insanity test. CLB qualified as insane.
 The story of the stolen Amulet Of      
 Wonderous Worth is reprinted (from Rant
 Vol 1, Issue 1) in this issue on the   
 following two pages.
 
 The "Great Amulet Caper" case is a story first mentioned in [Issue 1, Volume 1 of The Rant](https://frandallfarmer.github.io/neohabitat-doc/docs/historical/Text/text-08171987-rant-vol1-no1.json.html) and this courthouse appears to have been created as a way to continue that story and get avatars in Habitat to engage with the world and their fellow avatars.
 
 When the Pilot test for Habitat ended, a backup of the world was taken and a copy of that was made available when Habitat was first open sourced. This particular region didn't fully exist in that backup. Only the record of this region existing at all existed, alongside the regions name. It wasn't until the archives were inspected further that a copy of this region was found in its pre-imported into the database form.
 
 In September 2024, many original issues of The Rant newspaper and other miscellaneous documents were [rescued and transcribed](https://frandallfarmer.github.io/neohabitat-doc/docs/historical/Text/text-savingthepasttextrestoration.json.html) and that was instrumental in this region being restored to the world. From those documents, we learnt exactly where the courthouse was placed inworld, what its function was and when it was released to the public.

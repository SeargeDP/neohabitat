#  Apply: City Hall 

This store region was originally planned to be a blank area that avatars could apply to take ownership of and run themselves. Entrprys Street is the name of the street you are currently on where these stores once resided during the Habitat Pilot test.

In the Pilot test, all three store fronts were in use and their [names](https://frandallfarmer.github.io/neohabitat-doc/docs/historical/Text/text-03231988-rant-vol2-no10.json.html) were as follows:

* Furniture Store
* Pet Shop
* Second-Hand Store (Operated by an avatar named QWOP)

Unfortunately, this particular region didn't fully exist in the backups that were taken at the end of the Habitat Pilot test. The only things that were remained of it was an entry in the region database listing the regions name and region number. It wasn't until the archives were inspected further that a copy of this region was found in its pre-imported into the database form.

Three template regions were created with three unique store fronts. This was a common occurence in Habitat to save time so you could have similar looking regions but change the colors the regions use or the text on their signs and it'd look completely different.

What you see on Entrprys Street are these three template storefronts. It's likely that during their time in Habitat, their street signs would've included the name of their store, but we do not have any historical data to recreate that, so we present to you the store fronts as they would've been before the proprietors moved in.

 In September 2024, many original issues of The Rant newspaper and other miscellaneous documents were [rescued and transcribed](https://frandallfarmer.github.io/neohabitat-doc/docs/historical/Text/text-savingthepasttextrestoration.json.html) and that was instrumental in these regions being restored to the world. From those documents, we learnt exactly where the Entrprys Street was placed inworld, what regions belonged on that street and how it all connected to the rest of downtown Populopolis.

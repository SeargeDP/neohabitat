#  City Library 

The contents of the books in this library are restorations built from video archives recorded in 1988.

The books contain copies of many issues of *The Rant*, an in-world newspaper and maps and other documents.

We are able to get the dates for when certain events happened or when areas of Habitat had opened up to the public and capture a glimpse into the psyche of the Habitat world as it was at the time.

**Be sure to read *(DO)* the plaque within for more details about the meticulous restoration work finally completed in September 2024.**
There are also [web readable versions](https://frandallfarmer.github.io/neohabitat-doc/docs/historical/HabitatDocuments.html) of all the documents.

Documented here were key events from the Habitat pilot test that were later referenced in the influential paper ["Lessons of Lucasfilm's Habitat"](https://web.stanford.edu/class/history34q/readings/Virtual_Worlds/LucasfilmHabitat.html) paper by Chip Morningstar and Randy Farmer - only in much greater detail, with  names, places, times and dates.
